# PlagiarismDetectionTool


It is aimed to find the similarity ratio as accurately as possible and to present these results in a correct way to the user. In addition, it is also among the goals to have an idea about the results visually by showing them in detail to the user. The aim of the development of this project is to create more original projects in the software sector and to identify the source code similarity and to perform the necessary actions through these similarities.

These parts are this project foundation.
